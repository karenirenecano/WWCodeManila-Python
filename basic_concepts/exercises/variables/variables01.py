Description: Aling Nena’s Sari-sari store wants a robot that will ask the
customer their total bill and payment amount and tell them their change
(for now, we can allow negative change).

# Build your code below
totalBill = input('How much is your total bill:')
payment = input('How much is your payment:')
change = round(eval(totalBill) - eval(payment), 2)
print('Hi! Your change is {}'.format(change))  # String formatting replaces {} with variable values
